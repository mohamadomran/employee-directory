**Employee Directory Server**

Built using NestJS, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL.

**Notes**

1. I choose NestJS for the server of the **Employee Directory** because I find it more organized than plain NodeJs.
2. PostgresSQL for database (after I've done a quick revision in the weekend üòÅ).
3. I used [generatedata.com](generatedata.com) to generated mock data via a quert into my database table. (check [filldatat.txt](filldata.txt))
4.

- React, Typescript for the UI.
- Redux for state-management.
- React-Router for client-side navigation.
- Chakra-UI as a css-framework becasues it's typed.
- Formik and Yup for form and field's validation in React.

**Features Implemented**

1. Responsive Design for Web and Mobile.
2. Pagination.
3. Forms for Creating, and Editing employees.
4. Some Unit-tests for Server services.

**Features NOT Implemented üôÅ**

I wanted to commit to the ~8 hours time-frame and not exceed it for this code challenge, but I wanted to implement the following features:

- Search service for employees
- Sort Employees by Name
- MORE unit test (especially for the UI)
- Image Upload upon employee creation.
